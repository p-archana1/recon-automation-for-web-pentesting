THIS INTERNSHIP PROJECT, TITLED "RECON AUTOMATION FOR WEB PENTESTING," WAS CARRIED OUT AS PART OF MY INTERNSHIP AT [ 1Stop ]. 

THE AIM OF THE PROJECT WAS TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE TOOL IN PYTHON THAT AUTOMATES VARIOUS RECONNAISSANCE TASKS ESSENTIAL IN ETHICAL WEB PENETRATION TESTING (PENTESTING).

 THE TOOL INTEGRATES MULTIPLE FUNCTIONALITIES SUCH AS IP AND PORT SCANNING, BARCODE AND QR CODE GENERATION, WORDLIST AND PASSWORD GENERATION, SUBDOMAIN ENUMERATION, PHONE NUMBER INFORMATION GATHERING, AND A SIMULATED DDOS ATTACK. 
Reconnaissance is a crucial stage in penetration testing that involves gathering information about the target before executing any attacks. This tool was developed to automate the reconnaissance process, allowing ethical hackers and pentesters to gather information more efficiently.
The Python-based tool includes several key functionalities, including:

IP Scanning: Detecting live hosts.

Port Scanning: Checking if ports on a target are open or closed.

Barcode and QR Code Generation: Creating barcodes and QR codes from user input.

Password and Wordlist Generation: Creating strong passwords and wordlists for dictionary-based attacks.

Phone Number Information Gathering: Collecting information about a phone number using an API.

Subdomain Checker: Discovering subdomains of a target domain.

DDoS Simulation: A harmless simulation of a DDoS attack to demonstrate how it works.

 OBJECTIVES
The main objectives of the project were:
•	To create a Python tool that automates 
•	reconnaissance tasks for web pentesting.
•	To ensure the tool is user-friendly and easy to navigate.
•	To integrate multiple functionalities into a single program.
•	To demonstrate a simulated DDoS attack for educational purposes.
•	To enhance my knowledge of ethical hacking and automation tools.

 TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES USED
•	Python: The main programming language used for development.
•	Libraries: pyfiglet, qrcode, python-barcode, requests.
•	Operating System: Windows/Linux.
•	APIs: Used for phone number information gathering and subdomain checking.





SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

THE SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO BE MODULAR, WHERE EACH FUNCTIONALITY COULD BE SELECTED AND EXECUTED INDEPENDENTLY FROM THE MAIN MENU.

1 IP SCANNER
THE IP SCANNER FUNCTION USES THE PING COMMAND TO CHECK IF A TARGET HOST IS LIVE. A SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE INDICATES THAT THE TARGET IS REACHABLE.

2 PORT SCANNER
THE PORT SCANNER FUNCTION CHECKS FOR OPEN OR CLOSED PORTS ON A TARGET IP BY ATTEMPTING TO ESTABLISH A TCP CONNECTION. IF A CONNECTION IS SUCCESSFUL, THE PORT IS MARKED AS OPEN.

3 BARCODE GENERATOR
THIS FUNCTION GENERATES A BARCODE USING THE PYTHON-BARCODE LIBRARY. THE BARCODE CAN BE GENERATED FOR ANY INPUT DATA PROVIDED BY THE USER.

4 QR CODE GENERATOR
THE QR CODE GENERATOR USES THE QRCODE LIBRARY TO CREATE QR CODES FROM USER-PROVIDED DATA, WHICH CAN BE SAVED AS AN IMAGE.

5 PASSWORD GENERATOR
THE PASSWORD GENERATOR CREATES STRONG PASSWORDS OF VARYING LENGTHS, INCORPORATING UPPERCASE LETTERS, LOWERCASE LETTERS, DIGITS, AND SPECIAL CHARACTERS TO ENSURE COMPLEXITY.

6 WORDLIST GENERATOR
THIS FUNCTION ALLOWS USERS TO INPUT A SET OF WORDS, AND IT GENERATES PERMUTATIONS OF THOSE WORDS TO CREATE A WORDLIST. THE WORDLIST IS SAVED AS A TEXT FILE.

7 PHONE NUMBER INFORMATION GATHERING
THIS FEATURE USES AN EXTERNAL API TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT A PHONE NUMBER, SUCH AS COUNTRY, CARRIER, AND LINE TYPE.

8 SUBDOMAIN CHECKER
THE SUBDOMAIN CHECKER SEARCHES FOR SUBDOMAINS OF A GIVEN DOMAIN BY LEVERAGING AN ONLINE API SERVICE.

9 DDOS SIMULATION
THIS EDUCATIONAL FEATURE SIMULATES A DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE (DDOS) ATTACK BY SENDING MULTIPLE HTTP REQUESTS TO A TARGET URL IN RAPID SUCCESSION.


Results and Testing

The tool was tested on multiple target websites and IP addresses, and all functionalities were successfully validated:

IP and Port Scanners: Detected live hosts and open ports accurately.

Barcode and QR Code Generators: Generated and saved barcodes and QR codes as expected.

Password and Wordlist Generators: Created secure passwords and wordlists with the specified parameters.

Phone Number and Subdomain Lookup: Fetched the required information from the APIs and displayed it in a readable format.

DDoS Simulation: Simulated the DDoS attack without causing real damage to any servers, showing how such attacks are performed.

 Conclusion
The project successfully automated the reconnaissance tasks needed for web penetration testing, providing a user-friendly tool that integrates several essential functionalities. The tool's modular design ensures that individual functions can be executed independently, and it serves as a valuable addition to any pentester's toolkit.
